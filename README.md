# Diabetes-Prediction
The project involves the prediction of diabetes in an individual based on their social, demographic and health status. Machine learning models were created to test the classification, and were assessed based on their accuracy, sensitivity and area under curve.

# Code Description
  1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Four CSV files are loaded, combined, and cleaned. This includes handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical features.

  2. Data Splitting: The data is split into training, validation, and test sets.

  3. Model Training: Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) are trained using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

  4. Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Requirements
You should have a programming software like Python, using libraries pandas: numpy, sciki-learn, matplotlib
